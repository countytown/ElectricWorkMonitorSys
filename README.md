# ElectricWorkMonitorSystem
## Introduction
This is the source code for our paper "Real-time safety distance warning framework for proximity detection based on oriented object detection and pinhole model".  More information will be available soon.
A monitor system for electrical working, including object detection, tracking, and distance estimation. As shown in pictures and the video, numbers on the green lines are distances between insulator and helmet, white nmbers are estimated distances from camera to helmet(on the projection ground). Note that the video is randomly selected so the calibration parameters are based on experience. For better performance, please try adapt the code for your own purpose in real life, and replace corresponding settings.


## Dataset
We provide the original dataset (labeled) at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mYue8Jmjt5jzUoFmT_Sh0w, and the code is 99xn. The citation information will be available after acceptance and contact the author for usage permission before that.
