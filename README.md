# ElectricWorkMonitorSystem
A monitor system for electrical working, including object detection, tracking, and distance estimation. As showing in the pictures from a real working video, only persons within 1.0 meter with insulators are labeled and tracked. Numbers on the green lines show that the estimatede distances are relatively accurate.
