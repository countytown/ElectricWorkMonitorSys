# ElectricWorkMonitorSystem
A monitor system for electrical working, including object detection, tracking, and distance estimation. As showing in the pictures from a real working video, only persons within 1.0 meter with insulators are labeled and tracked. As shown in pictures (not calibrated since the ground truth distance is unknown), numbers on the green lines are distances between insulator and helmet, white nmbers are estimated distances from camera to helmet(on the projection ground).
